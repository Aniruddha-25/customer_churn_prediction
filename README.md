# Customer Churn Prediction

A web-based application built using Django  to predict customer churn based on travel data. This system helps analyze customer behavior and predict whether a customer is likely to churn using machine learning models.

## Features

1. **Model Training**  
    
    Train multiple machine learning models including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest classifiers.
1. **Prediction Interface**
    
    Input customer data to predict churn probability.
1. **Data Visualization**  
    
    Display training results and model accuracies with interactive charts.
1. **Dataset Management** 
    
    Load and preprocess customer travel data for analysis.
1. **Accuracy Metrics** 
    
    View and compare model performance metrics.
